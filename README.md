# Face Detection and Recognition

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of face detection and recognition using OpenCV and Python. The application can detect faces in images or video streams and recognize known faces.

## Introduction

Face detection and recognition is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame. It is commonly used in security systems and can be compared to other biometrics such as fingerprint or eye iris recognition systems.

## Features

- Detects faces in images and videos.
- Recognizes and labels known faces.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/Amn2652/Face-Detection-and-Recognition

Install the necessary Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Prepare your own dataset by running the code and pressing the 'n' key to generate data.
2. After adding people to the dataset, run the classifier code to train the recognizer.

### Example Commands

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Amn2652/Face-Detection-and-Recognition

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Face-Detection-and-Recognition

3. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the code to generate data and press 'n' to add new faces to the dataset.

5. Train the recognizer by running the classifier code.

Now you are ready to detect and recognize faces using the application.
